HashHedge: Bitcoin Hash Rate Derivatives on Layer 2
Project Overview
HashHedge is a specialized financial application built on top of the Ark protocol, a Bitcoin layer 2 solution. It enables users to create, trade, and settle binary options contracts that are based on Bitcoin network hash rate. These financial instruments allow users to speculate on or hedge against future Bitcoin network hash rate changes, providing a native Bitcoin solution for miners to manage energy price fluctuations and hash rate volatility.
The core innovation combines the efficiency of off-chain transactions with the security guarantees of the Bitcoin blockchain. HashHedge creates a trustless derivatives exchange specifically for hash rate contracts without requiring trusted third parties.
Fundamental Concepts
Ark Protocol and VTXOs
Ark is a layer 2 protocol for Bitcoin that enables off-chain transactions with minimal on-chain footprint. It operates using a concept called Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs), which are similar to Bitcoin's UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) but exist off-chain.
Key aspects of VTXOs:

A VTXO represents an off-chain claim to bitcoins that can be converted to an on-chain UTXO
VTXOs are secured by Bitcoin's scripting language and Taproot
VTXOs contain commitment mechanisms that ensure they can be redeemed on-chain if needed
The protocol uses a shared UTXO model where many users can have claims on a single on-chain UTXO

Ark Service Provider (ASP)
The Ark Service Provider is a central coordinator for the Ark protocol that:

Facilitates off-chain transactions but never takes custody of funds
Coordinates "rounds" where multiple transactions are batched together
Signs transactions along with users to authorize movement of funds
Provides an exit path for users in case the ASP becomes unavailable

Rounds and Connector Outputs
Ark transactions happen in "rounds" that follow this structure:

Multiple users can participate in a round to make payments
The ASP creates a transaction with outputs representing all participant payments
Users sign "forfeit transactions" that transfer their input VTXOs to the ASP
"Connector outputs" link the round transaction and forfeit transactions

Connector outputs ensure:

The forfeit transactions only become valid if the round transaction confirms
This creates atomicity between giving up old VTXOs and receiving new ones
The system prevents the ASP from taking user funds without providing new VTXOs

Out-of-Round (OOR) Transactions
Beyond standard rounds, Ark supports immediate peer-to-peer payments through:

Out-of-Round (OOR) transactions that are direct transfers between users
OOR transactions are co-signed by the ASP but don't require an on-chain transaction
OOR VTXOs can later be included in a round to convert them to regular VTXOs
These provide instant payments without requiring liquidity from the ASP

Taproot Scripts and Exit Paths
Ark leverages Bitcoin's Taproot capabilities for sophisticated script paths:

Key path spending is used for cooperative transactions
Script path spending provides fallback mechanisms if cooperation fails
Each VTXO includes multiple script paths for different scenarios
The "exit path" allows users to settle on-chain if the ASP disappears

Blockrate Binaries
Blockrate Binaries are the foundation for our HashHedge contracts, originally designed for on-chain implementation. These are binary option contracts on the future rate of Bitcoin block discovery.
Key elements of Blockrate Binaries:

They are peer-to-peer binary contracts on future block discovery rate
Settlement is based purely on on-chain data (block height vs. time)
They use pre-signed time-sensitive transactions for enforcement
No oracles or trusted third parties are required
They provide a censorship-resistant futures market for Bitcoin

Settlement mechanics:

Contract specifies a target block height and expected timestamp
If the target height is reached before the timestamp, high hash rate is confirmed
If the timestamp is reached before the target height, low hash rate is confirmed
This creates a binary outcome that can be settled without disputes

Coinflip Transaction Structure
The Coinflip application built on Ark provides a model for implementing complex contracts on the protocol. It uses a three-transaction structure:

Setup Transaction:

Takes VTXOs from both participating parties as inputs
Creates an output that forces the first player to reveal their secret
The output has a script path that allows the second player to claim funds after a timeout


Final Transaction:

Takes the Setup transaction output as input
Is pre-signed by both parties before the Setup transaction is submitted
Creates an output that forces the second player to reveal their secret
Has script paths for different outcomes based on the revealed secrets


Cashout Transaction:

Takes the Final transaction output as input
Is signed by the winner
Sends funds to the winner's address



This transaction structure ensures:

Neither party can cheat by seeing the other's move first
The game proceeds in the correct sequence
The winning condition is enforced automatically
Timeouts prevent a party from blocking the game by not participating
HashHedge Contract Structure
HashHedge will adapt the Blockrate Binaries concept to the Ark layer 2 protocol using a transaction structure similar to Coinflip. The contract will have:
1. Contract Setup Transaction
Inputs:
- VTXO from Party A (option buyer)
- VTXO from Party B (option seller)
→
Output:
- (A + B + contract parameters) OR (B after timeout)
- This forces both parties to commit to the contract parameters
2. Final Transaction
Input:
- Setup transaction output
- Pre-signed by A & B before the Setup transaction
→
Output:
- If actual block height reached before target timestamp: Party A's script path (for CALL)
- If target timestamp reached before block height: Party B's script path (for CALL)
- These outcomes are reversed for PUT options
- Exit path with timeout if either party becomes unresponsive
3. Settlement Transaction
Input:
- Final transaction output
- Signed by the winning party
→
Output:
- Winner's address receiving both parties' funds

4. Swap Transaction (for Trading)
Inputs:
- Contract VTXO with current participant
- VTXO from new participant
→
Output:
- Updated contract VTXO with new participant's public key
- Requires signatures from current participant, new participant, and ASP
Inputs:
- Contract VTXO with current participant
- VTXO from new participant
→
Output:
- Updated contract VTXO with new participant's public key
- Requires signatures from current participant, new participant, and ASP
Technical Implementation Details
Taproot Script Paths for Hash Rate Contracts
Each contract will use Taproot to encode multiple script paths:

1. Cooperative Settlement Path (key path spending):

Aggregated key of both participants and ASP
Used for normal cooperative settlement


2. High Hash Rate Path:
<target block height> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
<winner pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG


Can only be spent after reaching the target block height
Pays the winner based on contract type (Party A for CALL, Party B for PUT)
3. 
Low Hash Rate Path:
<target timestamp> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
<winner pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG


Can only be spent after reaching the target timestamp
Pays the winner based on contract type (Party B for CALL, Party A for PUT)
4.  Dispute Resolution Path:
<dispute timeout> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
<2> <party A pubkey> <party B pubkey> <ASP pubkey> <3> OP_CHECKMULTISIG

Used if there's a dispute about the outcome
Requires 2-of-3 signatures to resolve
5.
Refund Path:
<long timeout> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
<2> <party A pubkey> <party B pubkey> <2> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Ultimate fallback if all else fails
Returns funds to original participants
Hash Rate Calculation
Hash rate is derived from block discovery times using:
Hash Rate = (Difficulty × 2^32) ÷ (Average Block Time × 10^12)

The contract will track:

Starting block height
Ending block height
Block discovery times
Network difficulty

Order Book Implementation
The order book will maintain:

Buy orders (bids) sorted by price descending
Sell orders (asks) sorted by price ascending
Standard contract parameters for matching
Logic for matching compatible orders

Each order contains:

Contract parameters (strike hash rate, expiry, size)
Side (buy/sell)
Price
Quantity
Participant public key
Timestamp
Optional expiry

Contract Swap Mechanism
Contract positions can be transferred through:

Direct swaps:

Current participant initiates transfer to specific new participant
New participant provides collateral
All parties sign the swap transaction


Market trades:

Participants place buy/sell orders in the order book
When orders match, contracts are automatically created or transferred
The ASP facilitates the transaction and updates the contract



The swap process updates:

Participant public keys in the contract
All exit path scripts
Pre-signed transactions with new signatures

Contract Details and Parameters
Hash Rate Contract Specifications
Each hash rate contract includes:

Contract Type: CALL (betting hash rate increases) or PUT (betting hash rate decreases)
Strike Hash Rate: Target hash rate in EH/s (e.g., 350 EH/s)
Start Block Height: The block where measurement begins (e.g., current block + 100)
End Block Height: The block where measurement ends (e.g., start + 2016 for ~2 weeks)
Target Timestamp: Expected time for end block height (e.g., current time + 14 days)
Contract Size: Amount in satoshis committed by each party
Premium: Amount paid by option buyer to option seller
Participant Public Keys: Keys for both contract parties
Expiry: When the contract becomes invalid if not executed

Settlement Conditions
Settlement is triggered when either:

The blockchain reaches the target block height, or
The current time reaches the target timestamp

The outcome is determined by comparing these events:

For a CALL option:

If block height is reached first, Party A wins
If timestamp is reached first, Party B wins


For a PUT option:

If block height is reached first, Party B wins
If timestamp is reached first, Party A wins



Order Book Mechanics
The order matching process follows these steps:

Orders are placed with standardized contract parameters
The ASP maintains order books for each contract specification
When a buy price ≥ sell price, orders are matched
Contract size and party keys are set based on the matched orders
Setup and Final transactions are automatically created
Participants sign the transactions to activate the contract

Conclusion
HashHedge represents a significant innovation in Bitcoin's DeFi ecosystem by combining:

The efficiency and low cost of the Ark layer 2 protocol
The trustless nature of Bitcoin's scripting language
The financial utility of hash rate derivatives
The market mechanism of a decentralized order book

By implementing this system using VTXOs, connector outputs, and multi-transaction structures similar to Coinflip, we create a powerful financial tool that enables Bitcoin miners and investors to hedge against hash rate volatility without trusting third parties.
This comprehensive project plan provides the foundation for developing a fully functional, secure, and user-friendly hash rate derivatives exchange on Bitcoin's layer 2.
Final notes: remember that one of Ark's main benefits is that users do not need to rely on the ASP - they can always take a transaction on-chain if needed and turn their VTXO into a UTXO. We should make it easy for a user to unilaterally exit at any time. Remember also that users of HashHedge wish to speculate on whether the total network hashrate will be above or below a certain number of EH/s (and in the future, PH/s) by a certain date - blockrate binaries don't specifically allow this, but it's only a UX issue, users can certainly be presented their bets in these terms.
