Safeguards Against Different Cheating Scenarios
Let's analyze how the system prevents various cheating or griefing attacks:
1. User Attempts to Cheat Another User
Scenario: A user tries to claim funds that should go to the other party in a contract.
Prevention:

The 2-of-2 multisig requires both signatures in the cooperative case
The contract outcome is deterministically calculated based on blockchain data
The settlement transaction is constructed based on the verifiable outcome
Neither user can unilaterally change the contract terms or outcome

2. User Attempts to Grief by Refusing to Cooperate
Scenario: A user who's losing tries to block settlement by refusing to sign.
Prevention:

After the timeout period, the settlement can proceed without the uncooperative party
The OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY ensures the timeout path becomes available
The ASP can help resolve the situation by providing their signature

3. ASP Attempts to Cheat or Grief Users
Scenario: The ASP goes offline or refuses to cooperate.
Prevention:

The pre-signed exit transaction allows users to exit without ASP cooperation
After the absolute timelock expires, users can exit using just their key
The exit transaction is fully signed during onboarding and stored by the user
The user doesn't need to request any additional signatures


Understanding the Full Exit Path
Let's trace through a complete exit path to understand all safeguards:

User Deposit:

Creates a vTXO with a pre-signed exit transaction
Exit transaction can be broadcast at any time


Contract Creation:

Funds are locked in a 2-of-2 multisig between participants
Multiple exit paths are built into the contract


Normal Settlement:

Contract reaches expiration
Outcome is determined based on hash rate data
Settlement transaction pays the winner


Non-cooperative Settlement:

After the timeout period, alternative paths activate
The correct winner can still receive funds based on verifiable data
The ASP can help resolve disputes


ASP Failure Recovery:

Users can broadcast their pre-signed exit transaction
The VTXO sweeper provides an additional recovery mechanism



The system ensures that funds always have a path back to their rightful owner, even in worst-case scenarios where participants become unresponsive or attempt to cheat.
Conclusion
The 2-of-2 multisig with timeout mechanism in HashHedge provides a robust foundation for derivative contracts. It allows efficient cooperative settlements in the normal case, while ensuring funds can always be recovered in non-cooperative scenarios.

The combination of:

Pre-signed exit transactions
Timelocked script paths
ASP-assisted dispute resolution
Automated VTXO sweeping

Creates a system where users cannot effectively grief each other, the ASP cannot block withdrawals, and funds always have a path back to their rightful owners.
This design exemplifies the principle of "don't trust, verify" - users don't need to trust other participants or the ASP because cryptographic guarantees and timelocks ensure they can always recover their funds independently.
